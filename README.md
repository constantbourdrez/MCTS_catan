# MCTS-Catan

A Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the board game Catan. This project explores reinforcement learning techniques applied to complex board games, focusing on self-play and policy learning within constrained computational settings.

## 🔍 Features

- Rule-based simulation of Catan, including resource management, building, trading, and development cards.
- MCTS for action selection with adjustable exploration parameters.
- Neural network policy trained from self-play data.

Scaling to a more robust multi-game-per-update training approach is a direction for future work.
